It was here in one of the most invigorating environments I've ever been in that I got introduced to the linguistics olympiads and the broader field of academia in general.

I qualified the national rounds 3 years in a row (2022, 2023 and 2024) as well as making it to the IOL 2 years in a row (2023, 2024). I earned a Bronze Medal at the Asia Pacific Linguistics Olympiad in both 2023 and 2024, placing 8th and 3rd in those years respectively. I now serve on the Problem Committee and Organising Committee of the Panini Linguistics Olympiad, as well as contribute problems to various other Linguistics Olympiads.",
